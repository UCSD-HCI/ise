	            The VISCA(tm) Camera Control Library

(This README is for version 1.0.0)

Nothing special. You should know by now that this lib is for controlling a
VISCA compliant camera (VISCA is a control protocol of Sony Corp.)

This library should also compile under windows but this is untested.

Comments, additional VISCA info, etc... are always welcome.

Have fun,

Damien
